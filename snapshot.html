                <p class="afacad-flux-regular"> Initially, the plan consisted in week 1 of all of us working on the team
                    forming activities,
                    creating our team logo and
                    coming up with the name GeNext. We discussed briefly about what possible ideas we would use to
                    complete our product
                    brief however nothing was set in stone as the assessment document was not released.</p>

                <p class="afacad-flux-regular"> In week 2, we read the assessment as a group to decide what tasks people
                    would be best at doing as well as what people
                    most preferred to do. We also worked on interview questions for our stakeholder to elicit user
                    requirements from them.
                    Our intention was to do this on week 2 and start the write up for requirements. Furthermore, we
                    discussed possible
                    methodologies to use, concluding Agile- Scrum was the best.</p>

                <p class="afacad-flux-regular"> During week 3, we conducted interviews as we were unable to secure a
                    meeting in time for week 2. The write up for
                    requirements began towards the end of the week and a plan for each week was devised based on the
                    tasks we needed to
                    complete. Additionally, we started to analyse any potential risks that could occur. Research was
                    also conducted to
                    discuss how the architecture would be handled and an interim version of UML designs was started. On
                    the implementation
                    side, the website was made using HTML and CSS and research into what game engine and libraries was
                    conducted. LibGDX was
                    confirmed to be our game engine and the implementation team started to practise using this.</p>

                    designs and began working on creating behavioural
                    diagrams. For requirements, they were still getting finished, often getting updated to fit the
                    userâ€™s needs.
                    Additionally, throughout week 4 a risk register was made to combat any potential problems that may
                    occur. The
                    implementation team began to create the initial map mid-week and on Friday the discussion of what
                    main classes should be
                    included began.</p>

                    identified. The architecture team finished behavioural diagrams allowing the implementation team to
                    carry on with their
                    progress. The implementation team created the classes used in the game and began working on camera

                    Friday as well. On the implementation side, the UI system was designed and made. Finally, the
                    documentation for the code
                    was completed and all formatting of PDFs was done.</p>
